Make an Impact as a Technical Product Manager
As a PM-T, you will manage the development of one or several analytic products serving a wide breadth of industries. Mastercard's diverse suite of products enables PM-Ts to work on a variety of exciting projects, including:
 User research - You will lead the discovery phase of new features. What business problems are users trying to tackle? How are they doing that today, both in our software and externally? What are their biggest pain points with that process, and how can we design a product which best helps them?
 Prioritization - You will partner with roles across the organization including consultants, engineering, and sales to determine the highest priority problems to solve.
 Solution Scoping - You will evaluate trade-offs between many possible solutions to a problem, taking into account usability, technical feasibility, client timelines, and differing stakeholder opinions to make a decision.
 Release Management - Mastercard believes in an agile approach to software development, so PM-Ts break large features into smaller, releasable milestones to collect feedback from users as early as possible. You will be responsible for evangelizing releases to users, incorporating feedback, and tracking usage to inform future development.
PM-Ts also dive deeper into:
 Analytic Investigations - We are an analytics company. PM-Ts partner with engineers and consultants to develop innovative analytic solutions to complex business problems.
 Design Projects - At Mastercard, design isn't left just to CX designers. Together with designers, PM-Ts create mockups for features, overhaul existing designs, and institute innovative UX paradigms.
 Product Marketing - PM-Ts collaborate with sales & marketing to craft the best way to communicate the value of our products to potential clients.
How will I do that?
As a PM-T, you will sit and work with small, cross-functional engineering teams dedicated to one or more of Mastercard, Data and Services products.
 You will work with the team to define a vision, establish team culture and processes, and create functional requirements and designs.
 Given our emphasis on agile development, you will share ideas early, collaborate with teammates, and rapidly incorporate new feedback and ideas.
 You will quickly develop skills in universally-used software such as SQL and R, and gain experience in industry-standard software like InVision, Splunk, and the Atlassian suite.
 You will stay engaged throughout the feature life cycle, bridging gaps between designers, engineers, consultants, and users.
What does this mean for me?
PM-Ts grow rapidly in their careers, receiving mentorship from senior leaders and taking advantage of the diverse opportunities Mastercard offers:
 Grow as a product leader by owning team direction and evangelizing the product vision throughout the organization

",Gurgaon,"Are you interested in taking part in building the most exciting mobile platform in the world? Used by millions of people in the world, the Uber mobile app re-invented the world of transportation, and every day we work fearlessly towards one goal: make transportation for everyone as easy and reliable as possible around the world.
 
We are looking for exceptional engineers willing to share this challenge as members of our program teams. You will play a central role in the end-to-end development of entire new functionalities aimed at Android or iOS devices, working side-by-side with our backend and design specialists. In Uber you will be empowered with trust to make the right decisions, a community of inspiring peers, a hyper-advanced technological stack and, of course, a real opportunity to shape our times.
 
We expect from you a true passion for crafting software with rapidity and the highest quality, confidence in taking the lead in solving complex problems, and just the right mix of un-compromised individual dedication and a sharp attitude for un-tapping your groups potential by seeking convergence and acting as a mentor, every day.
 
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?
Strong coding abilities. You have advanced knowledge of at least one programming language, and of OOP patterns. Youve used programming tools (e.g. version control) and already have a couple of full stack projects under your belt. 
Fast learner. Were looking for software engineers who perk up learning new technologies or a new partner API. You keep yourself up-to-date with the latest technological trends. Youre constantly on the lookout for opportunities to try out new things. 
Speed and quality. You strive on proving that these are not mutually exclusive  that you can achieve both at the same time. You obsess about delivering business results as fast as possible. 
Ownership. You feel ownership over everything you ship; youd never call code released until youre confident its correct, fast and elegant. You pride yourself on thorough monitoring, concise up-to-date documentation, and adequate test coverage. 
You thrive in a startup culture where all hands are on deck, and consider no challenge too big or too small. 
A standout colleague. You believe that you can achieve more when you work in a team  that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. You rely on others candid feedback for continuous improvement. You want to work with different finance, mobile, product, design and fraud teams to build the best solution for Uber. 
Design and business insight. You understand requirements beyond the written word. Whether youre working on an API used by other developers, an internal tool consumed by our operation teams, or a feature used by millions of customers, your attention to detail leads to a delightful user experience. 

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
B.Tech or Integrated Dual Degree (anticipated graduation in 2020) in Computer Science, Electronics Eng, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical or Mathematical Sciences or related fields


Strong data skills and the ability to learn to use tools such as SQL, Python, R, and GIS mapping tools to work efficiently at scale


The capacity to work independently and execute with minimal oversight


The ability to organize and synthesize analyses and communicate data insights with clarity


Enthusiasm for learning and growth


The rare opportunity to change the world such that everyone around you is using the product you built. Were not just another social web app, were moving real people and assets and reinventing transportation and logistics globally.","

Company Description	EagleView is a technology company that utilizes computer vision and proprietary high-resolution aerial imagery to modernize workflows and help professionals across different industries make informed decisions. EagleViews image superiority stemming from multi-modal capture from drones, low-flying aircraft and satellite, and patented capture technology, sets them apart from competitors. EagleView solutions are targeted to local government (property assessment, GIS, and public safety), construction (roofing), insurance (property claims and underwriting), and energy (solar, oil and gas, electric utilities) industries. 

EagleView is a fast-growing company headquartered in Bellevue, Washington with offices in Rochester, New York, and an international office in Perth, Australia.

Product Portfolio Overview	●	Imagery: Aerial imagery that displays orthogonal (top-down) and oblique (birds-eye view) perspectives. Advanced proprietary camera systems to generate ultra-high resolution imagery - imagery as fine as .075 GSD for orthogonal (top-down) and 1.0 GSD for oblique (angled) imagery.  
●	Property data: Property data including attributes and measurements, derived from aerial imagery and other capture methods, that can be accessed by customers through APIs, or ordered online. EagleView also applies its Computer Vision to generate other insights including change detection. 
●	Workflow solutions: EagleView enables virtual inspections that digitize the workflow for both insurance carriers and their customers. Using a combination of imagery, Computer Vision, and virtual inspection solutions (drone led or ""boots-on-the ground""), EagleView accelerates insurance claims processing.

●	The technology span of the business is broad giving you the opportunity to gain experience in various areas such as high resolution imagery generation, drone technology, mobile app development, SaaS, Big Data, Computer Vision and Machine Learning and eCommerce.
●	The solution stack cuts across hardware, software and services giving you an opportunity to develop solutions across these elements - something that can't be said for a lot of technology companies that only focus on one of these areas. 

Work with smart and accomplished colleagues, and for a leadership that has a track record of success
●	Work with professionals who are the best in their field from leading tech companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and HP to break new ground in imagery capture, computer vision, and workflow transformation.

Have a global impact while remaining in India
	You'll work with never seen amounts of geospatial data which will be used to solve important everyday problems. In the case of natural disasters or distress situations, you'll be helping to improve and potentially save lives from your seat oceans away. 
Join a new entrant to Indias Silicon Valley
	Unlike better known tech companies headquartered nearby, EagleView offers a startup culture where a lot still needs to be defined. EagleView will challenge you like a tech startup should and give growth opportunities not available in mature tech companies.

We are looking for a data scientist with a strong background in natural language processing, data mining, machine learning, and statistics to join the Data Science Lab. Your primary responsibility will be in applying data science to one or more of the following problems: Content Intelligence: The content intelligence stack at Embibe focuses on the various hard open problems including automated ingestion of content, smart tagging of content, and intelligent content packaging.  Student Intelligence: The student intelligence stack at Embibe includes student activity finite state modeling and student ability calibration. Student finite state modeling places each student in one or more states based on their activity on Embibes platform, thereby enabling personlised treatment in order to boost engagement and retention. The student calibration system calibrates students academically and behaviorally, serving as a base for mentor intelligence. Mentor Intelligence: The mentor intelligence stack at Embibe deals with personalized content discovery, learning recommendation, and behavioral intervention. Personalized content discovery makes sure that students are served with the content that they expect weighted by what our models think can best impact their learning outcomes. Learning recommendation keeps students up on the learning curve, while behavioral intervention targets a student's behavioral gaps and addresses them with remedies to boost learning outcomes. 
 
Embibes data science problem landscape touches on techniques including stochastic optimization, supervised and semi-supervised classification, clustering and topic modelling, semantic analysis, graph mining, anomaly detection, and time series analysis among others. The ideal candidate for this position will be a highly motivated individual with innovative ideas and solid coding skills, who is equally comfortable with developing new algorithms, and deploying science-proof solutions in a scalable manner. The candidate should be able to work closely with other senior data scientists and mentor junior data scientists when in senior roles, while collaborating productively with our engineering, product, marketing, content, and business partners.","
