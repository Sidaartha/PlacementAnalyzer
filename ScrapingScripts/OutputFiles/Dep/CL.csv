Used by millions of people in the world, the Uber mobile app re-invented the world of transportation, and every day we work fearlessly towards one goal: make transportation for everyone as easy and reliable as possible around the world.
 
We are looking for exceptional engineers willing to share this challenge as members of our program teams. You will play a central role in the end-to-end development of entire new functionalities aimed at Android or iOS devices, working side-by-side with our backend and design specialists. In Uber you will be empowered with trust to make the right decisions, a community of inspiring peers, a hyper-advanced technological stack and, of course, a real opportunity to shape our times.
 
We expect from you a true passion for crafting software with rapidity and the highest quality, confidence in taking the lead in solving complex problems, and just the right mix of un-compromised individual dedication and a sharp attitude for un-tapping your groups potential by seeking convergence and acting as a mentor, every day.

Speed and quality. You strive on proving that these are not mutually exclusive  that you can achieve both at the same time. You obsess about delivering business results as fast as possible.

You thrive in a startup culture where all hands are on deck, and consider no challenge too big or too small. 
A standout colleague. You believe that you can achieve more when you work in a team  that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. You rely on others candid feedback for continuous improvement. You want to work with different finance, mobile, product, design and fraud teams to build the best solution for Uber. 
Design and business insight. You understand requirements beyond the written word. Whether youre working on an API used by other developers, an internal tool consumed by our operation teams, or a feature used by millions of customers, your attention to detail leads to a delightful user experience.

",Gurgaon,"Description 
 
If you want to use Artificial Intelligence to solve the most pressing problems in the Indian logistics industry, or optimize the distribution network of Indias largest third party logistics provider, our data team is the place to be. We are the countrys premium data science team featured widely in press and news; see Factordaily, LeMonde, Economic Times 1, Economic Times 2. 
 
The team comprises of leading experts in the field of Operations Research and Particle Physics, along with budding engineers and scientists in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 
 
In the recent past, the data science team at Delhivery has built key capabilities in the following areas: 
  Maps:  
 Our business relies heavily on understanding where our end customers live and how to get there. This is a huge India specific challenge, primarily because of the unstandardized way of writing addresses and poor quality of road/pincode data in smaller towns/villages. We process a large amount of location data from our devices on the ground to learn locality boundaries, routes taken by ground staff, etc. 
  Machine Learning:  
 We use a range of machine learning techniques to automate decision making at the ground level, e.g., identifying whether a shipment is safe to fly based on its product description, identifying which shipments have a high probability of being returned, etc. 
  Discrete Optimization:  
 We rely on a range of optimization methods to ensure our distribution network is designed for cost efficiencies and scale, e.g., Vehicle Routing Problem to optimize the shipment collection process from clients, Facility Location Problem to ensure our distribution centres are suitably located, etc. 
 Simulation:  
 The scale of our distribution network often makes many problems intractable due to the existence of millions of variables and how they interact with each other over time. We are investing to build an in-house Simulator to enable us to measure the impact of changes in the network over time and ultimately design a system that can be self aware"". 
 We are looking to expand our team to further our capabilities in these areas. 
 
Responsibilities: 
  Contribute to the development/ deployment of machine learning algorithms, operational research, semantic analysis, and statistical methods for finding 
structure in large data sets  Use advanced statistics and machine learning on large scale multidimensional data and generate actionable insights that will be leveraged to drive operations and 
develop strategies for Delhivery.  Breakdown business problems by working closely with Product Team and Leadership Management Team, analyze requirements and look into data to 
recommend products and solutions  Optimize Delhivery operations by applying data science in solving complex business problems  Collaborate with cross-functional teams including but not limited to Logistics, BD, Sales, Marketing, Security, Customer Service, etc.  Disseminate original research in peer reviewed journals and conferences Qualifications 
 
A suitable candidate should satisfy as many of the following requirements: 
  B.Tech/PhD/M.Tech/M.S in Computer Science, Operational Research, Statistics, Applied Mathematics or Natural Sciences with a very clear understanding of probability and statistics, analytical approach to problem solving, and capability to think critically on a diverse array of problems.

Company Description	EagleView is a technology company that utilizes computer vision and proprietary high-resolution aerial imagery to modernize workflows and help professionals across different industries make informed decisions. EagleViews image superiority stemming from multi-modal capture from drones, low-flying aircraft and satellite, and patented capture technology, sets them apart from competitors. EagleView solutions are targeted to local government (property assessment, GIS, and public safety), construction (roofing), insurance (property claims and underwriting), and energy (solar, oil and gas, electric utilities) industries. 

EagleView is a fast-growing company headquartered in Bellevue, Washington with offices in Rochester, New York, and an international office in Perth, Australia. To support its growth strategy, EagleView recently opened its Engineering Center of Excellence (COE) in Bangalore, India  a world-class facility it intends to staff with leading software engineering talent.

	In just the last 24 months, it has generated 50+ petabytes of imagery  roughly 300 million images.
	EagleView flies over 9.5M linear miles each year to capture its imagery.
	For its various customers, it generates 20K+ reports per day.
	Its transforming workflows performing 4.3M virtual inspections in 2018 diminishing companies reliance on high-carbon footprint physical inspections and lowering labor safety risks.

Product Portfolio Overview	●	Imagery: Aerial imagery that displays orthogonal (top-down) and oblique (birds-eye view) perspectives. Advanced proprietary camera systems to generate ultra-high resolution imagery - imagery as fine as .075 GSD for orthogonal (top-down) and 1.0 GSD for oblique (angled) imagery.  
●	Property data: Property data including attributes and measurements, derived from aerial imagery and other capture methods, that can be accessed by customers through APIs, or ordered online. EagleView also applies its Computer Vision to generate other insights including change detection. 
●	Workflow solutions: EagleView enables virtual inspections that digitize the workflow for both insurance carriers and their customers. Using a combination of imagery, Computer Vision, and virtual inspection solutions (drone led or ""boots-on-the ground""), EagleView accelerates insurance claims processing.

Why EagleView?	Join a company thats still small enough where you can have impact, yet big enough to support your career ambitions
●	With a little over 700 full-time employees worldwide, EagleView is a relatively small company where you can make a difference and be very productive. While there's process, you can sidestep the bureaucracy of large multi-national tech companies. You can focus your energy on understanding the business and technology problems that need solving and move to execution rather seamlessly. That said, the company is mature enough to give you the opportunity to move into new lateral roles where you might want to learn new skills, or get promoted to increase your scope. You're not going to get stuck at a level because colleagues are ""resting and vesting"". You have mobility which is critical to career growth.
●	The technology span of the business is broad giving you the opportunity to gain experience in various areas such as high resolution imagery generation, drone technology, mobile app development, SaaS, Big Data, Computer Vision and Machine Learning and eCommerce.
●	The solution stack cuts across hardware, software and services giving you an opportunity to develop solutions across these elements - something that can't be said for a lot of technology companies that only focus on one of these areas. 

Work with smart and accomplished colleagues, and for a leadership that has a track record of success
●	Work with professionals who are the best in their field from leading tech companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and HP to break new ground in imagery capture, computer vision, and workflow transformation.

Why the EagleView Engineering Center of Excellence in Bangalore?	Build the next generation platform
	The EagleView Engineering Center of Excellence (COE) is building the next generation infrastructure that EagleView's business is based upon. It's mission-critical work. All cloud-based software development for the company will be built and driven out of India. 
	The next generation platform you will be building will enable EagleView to collect more data in the next 18 months than in the company's 15-year history.
Have a global impact while remaining in India
	You'll work with never seen amounts of geospatial data which will be used to solve important everyday problems. In the case of natural disasters or distress situations, you'll be helping to improve and potentially save lives from your seat oceans away. 
Join a new entrant to Indias Silicon Valley
	Unlike better known tech companies headquartered nearby, EagleView offers a startup culture where a lot still needs to be defined. EagleView will challenge you like a tech startup should and give growth opportunities not available in mature tech companies.
EagleView Culture	Culture
