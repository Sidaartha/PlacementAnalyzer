Used by millions of people in the world, the Uber mobile app re-invented the world of transportation, and every day we work fearlessly towards one goal: make transportation for everyone as easy and reliable as possible around the world.
 
We are looking for exceptional engineers willing to share this challenge as members of our program teams. You will play a central role in the end-to-end development of entire new functionalities aimed at Android or iOS devices, working side-by-side with our backend and design specialists. In Uber you will be empowered with trust to make the right decisions, a community of inspiring peers, a hyper-advanced technological stack and, of course, a real opportunity to shape our times.
 
We expect from you a true passion for crafting software with rapidity and the highest quality, confidence in taking the lead in solving complex problems, and just the right mix of un-compromised individual dedication and a sharp attitude for un-tapping your groups potential by seeking convergence and acting as a mentor, every day.
 
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?
Strong coding abilities. You have advanced knowledge of at least one programming language, and of OOP patterns. Youve used programming tools (e.g. version control) and already have a couple of full stack projects under your belt. 
Fast learner. Were looking for software engineers who perk up learning new technologies or a new partner API. You keep yourself up-to-date with the latest technological trends. Youre constantly on the lookout for opportunities to try out new things. 
Speed and quality. You strive on proving that these are not mutually exclusive  that you can achieve both at the same time. You obsess about delivering business results as fast as possible. 
Ownership. You feel ownership over everything you ship; youd never call code released until youre confident its correct, fast and elegant. You pride yourself on thorough monitoring, concise up-to-date documentation, and adequate test coverage. 
You thrive in a startup culture where all hands are on deck, and consider no challenge too big or too small. 
A standout colleague. You believe that you can achieve more when you work in a team  that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. You rely on others candid feedback for continuous improvement. You want to work with different finance, mobile, product, design and fraud teams to build the best solution for Uber. 
Design and business insight. You understand requirements beyond the written word. Whether youre working on an API used by other developers, an internal tool consumed by our operation teams, or a feature used by millions of customers, your attention to detail leads to a delightful user experience. 

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
B.Tech or Integrated Dual Degree (anticipated graduation in 2020) in Computer Science, Electronics Eng, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical or Mathematical Sciences or related fields


Strong data skills and the ability to learn to use tools such as SQL, Python, R, and GIS mapping tools to work efficiently at scale


The capacity to work independently and execute with minimal oversight


The ability to organize and synthesize analyses and communicate data insights with clarity


Enthusiasm for learning and growth


The rare opportunity to change the world such that everyone around you is using the product you built. Were not just another social web app, were moving real people and assets and reinventing transportation and logistics globally.","

If you want to use Artificial Intelligence to solve the most pressing problems in the Indian logistics industry, or optimize the distribution network of Indias largest third party logistics provider, our data team is the place to be. We are the countrys premium data science team featured widely in press and news; see Factordaily, LeMonde, Economic Times 1, Economic Times 2. 
 
The team comprises of leading experts in the field of Operations Research and Particle Physics, along with budding engineers and scientists in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 
 
In the recent past, the data science team at Delhivery has built key capabilities in the following areas: 
  Maps:  
 Our business relies heavily on understanding where our end customers live and how to get there. This is a huge India specific challenge, primarily because of the unstandardized way of writing addresses and poor quality of road/pincode data in smaller towns/villages. We process a large amount of location data from our devices on the ground to learn locality boundaries, routes taken by ground staff, etc. 
  Machine Learning:  
 We use a range of machine learning techniques to automate decision making at the ground level, e.g., identifying whether a shipment is safe to fly based on its product description, identifying which shipments have a high probability of being returned, etc. 
  Discrete Optimization:  
 We rely on a range of optimization methods to ensure our distribution network is designed for cost efficiencies and scale, e.g., Vehicle Routing Problem to optimize the shipment collection process from clients, Facility Location Problem to ensure our distribution centres are suitably located, etc. 
 Simulation:  
 The scale of our distribution network often makes many problems intractable due to the existence of millions of variables and how they interact with each other over time. We are investing to build an in-house Simulator to enable us to measure the impact of changes in the network over time and ultimately design a system that can be self aware"". 
 We are looking to expand our team to further our capabilities in these areas. 
 
Responsibilities: 
  Contribute to the development/ deployment of machine learning algorithms, operational research, semantic analysis, and statistical methods for finding 
structure in large data sets  Use advanced statistics and machine learning on large scale multidimensional data and generate actionable insights that will be leveraged to drive operations and 
develop strategies for Delhivery.  Breakdown business problems by working closely with Product Team and Leadership Management Team, analyze requirements and look into data to 
recommend products and solutions  Optimize Delhivery operations by applying data science in solving complex business problems  Collaborate with cross-functional teams including but not limited to Logistics, BD, Sales, Marketing, Security, Customer Service, etc.  Disseminate original research in peer reviewed journals and conferences Qualifications 
 
A suitable candidate should satisfy as many of the following requirements: 
  B.Tech/PhD/M.Tech/M.S in Computer Science, Operational Research, Statistics, Applied Mathematics or Natural Sciences with a very clear understanding of probability and statistics, analytical approach to problem solving, and capability to think critically on a diverse array of problems.

Student Intelligence: The student intelligence stack at Embibe includes student activity finite state modeling and student ability calibration. Student finite state modeling places each student in one or more states based on their activity on Embibes platform, thereby enabling personlised treatment in order to boost engagement and retention. The student calibration system calibrates students academically and behaviorally, serving as a base for mentor intelligence. Mentor Intelligence: The mentor intelligence stack at Embibe deals with personalized content discovery, learning recommendation, and behavioral intervention. Personalized content discovery makes sure that students are served with the content that they expect weighted by what our models think can best impact their learning outcomes. Learning recommendation keeps students up on the learning curve, while behavioral intervention targets a student's behavioral gaps and addresses them with remedies to boost learning outcomes. 
 
Embibes data science problem landscape touches on techniques including stochastic optimization, supervised and semi-supervised classification, clustering and topic modelling, semantic analysis, graph mining, anomaly detection, and time series analysis among others. The ideal candidate for this position will be a highly motivated individual with innovative ideas and solid coding skills, who is equally comfortable with developing new algorithms, and deploying science-proof solutions in a scalable manner. The candidate should be able to work closely with other senior data scientists and mentor junior data scientists when in senior roles, while collaborating productively with our engineering, product, marketing, content, and business partners.","
